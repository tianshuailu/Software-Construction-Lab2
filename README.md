# Software-Construction-Lab2
This lab trains the design, specification, testing of abstract data types (ADTs) and implements ADT using object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques. Specifically:
- Identify the required ADT from the problem description for a given application problem;
- Design test cases according to ADT's specifications;
- Generalization of ADT;
- Use OOP to implement ADT, and determine whether the invariance is violated, and whether each implementation has a rep exposure;
- Test the implementation of ADT and evaluate the coverage of the test;
- Develop programs for application problems using ADT and its implementation;
